Critical Review and Theoretical Deconstruction of "The Theory of Topological Time-Stitching"1. Introduction: The Crisis of Continuity and the Process ParadigmThe contemporary landscape of theoretical physics is defined by a persistent and troubling schism: the incompatibility between the smooth, deterministic geometry of General Relativity (GR) and the discrete, probabilistic formalism of Quantum Mechanics (QM). For nearly a century, efforts to unify these frameworks have typically involved quantizing gravity—attempting to break the smooth spacetime manifold into gravitons or discrete loops. However, the manuscript under review, "The Theory of Topological Time-Stitching: A Unified Geometric Framework for Discrete Spacetime, Quantum Branching, and Relativistic Mechanics" by Jose L. S. Alvarenga 1, proposes a radical inversion of this standard approach. Rather than quantizing gravity, the author proposes "stitching" time.This report provides an exhaustive, expert-level analysis of the "Topological Time-Stitching" framework. The theory posits a fundamental ontological shift from the "Block Universe"—a static 4-dimensional manifold where past, present, and future coexist—to a "Process Universe." In this view, time is not a dimension but a discrete, iterative operation—a "Tick"—occurring on a stochastic causal network.1 The central thesis is that fundamental particles are not continuous entities but propagating "helical excitations" defined by a discrete phase-locking cycle.By imposing a single, rigorous geometric constraint—that the total vector velocity of the helix must equal the network update speed $c$—Alvarenga claims to derive the de Broglie wavelength, the Lorentz factor of Special Relativity, and the Gullstrand-Painlevé form of the Schwarzschild metric.1 Furthermore, a topological closure condition (the "Stitch") is introduced to explain energy quantization and the emergence of mass stability bands. This review will dissect the mathematical foundations, physical intuition, and phenomenological predictions of the theory, placing it within the broader context of Causal Set Theory and emergent gravity.1.1 The Ontological Schism: Block vs. ProcessThe distinction between the Block Universe and the Process Universe is not merely semantic; it dictates the mathematical machinery available to the physicist. In the standard Block Universe, worldlines are immutable curves in a pre-existing spacetime $\mathcal{M}$. Dynamics are static geometric relations. Alvarenga's critique, identified as the "Discontinuity Problem," argues that this view fails to account for the mechanism of temporal succession in a discrete regime.The "Discontinuity Problem" posits that in a discrete universe, time is a series of frames. A particle existing in Frame 1 ($t_1$) must algorithmically calculate its position in Frame 2 ($t_2$). If space is not a continuum, there is no inherent "slide" from one coordinate to the next. The particle must "stitch" itself to the new configuration. This necessitates an active, computational agent—the "Helical Excitation"—rather than a passive point mass.1 This move aligns the theory with digital physics and computational universe hypotheses, yet it retains a geometric character that allows for the recovery of analog symmetries.1.2 The Stochastic SubstrateTo construct a discrete spacetime without violating Lorentz invariance—a common fatal flaw in regular grid-based theories—Alvarenga employs a Stochastic Causal Network generated via Poisson Sprinkling.1 This methodology draws upon the foundational work of Bombelli and Sorkin on Causal Sets.1The substrate is defined by two Planck-scale parameters:Average Node Separation ($L_0$): The spatial granularity of the network.Universal Update Frequency ($f_0$): The temporal "clock rate" of the universe.The use of a Poisson distribution is critical. A regular lattice (like a cubic grid) has preferred directions (axes), which would render the speed of light anisotropic, violating Special Relativity. A Poisson-sprinkled network, however, is statistically isotropic; there is no preferred frame. The innovation in this paper is the introduction of the "Helix" as a coherent excitation on top of this stochastic background, bridging the gap between the noisy substrate and the smooth propagation of matter fields.2. The Geometric Foundation: Helical Dynamics and the Strict ModeThe core generative engine of the Topological Time-Stitching theory is the geometric modeling of the particle state. The paper moves away from the notion of a particle as a point-like singularity ($x, y, z$) and redefines it as a periodic process described by a Master Equation. This equation couples the internal phase space of the particle to its external trajectory.2.1 The Master EquationThe trajectory $\vec{S}(t)$ of a particle is modeled as a 3D helical excitation. It is essential to understand that this helix is likely defined in a configuration space that maps to physical observables, rather than a literal corkscrew of matter moving through the ether. The equation is given as:$$\vec{S}(t) = \langle A \sin(\omega t), A \cos(\omega t), v_d t \rangle$$Here, the state vector is decomposed into orthogonal components:Transverse Components ($x, y$): $A \sin(\omega t)$ and $A \cos(\omega t)$ represent the internal phase cycle. The parameter $A$ is the amplitude, representing the spatial extent of the phase, and $\omega$ is the internal frequency.Longitudinal Component ($z$): $v_d t$ represents the linear translation of the particle through the network, where $v_d$ is the observed Drift Velocity.1This decomposition is mathematically reminiscent of the Zitterbewegung (jittery motion) predicted by the Dirac equation, where the instantaneous velocity of an electron is $c$, but its average observed velocity is less than $c$. Alvarenga formalizes this "jitter" as a coherent helical geometry.2.2 The Fundamental Constraint (Strict Mode)The most significant postulate of the paper is the "Fundamental Constraint," also termed "Strict Mode." It asserts a conservation law for the "processing speed" of the causal network. The theory demands that the magnitude of the total velocity vector of the excitation must strictly equal the network update speed $c$.$$|\vec{v}_{total}|^2 = (A\omega)^2 + v_d^2 = c^2$$This equation ($v_{rot}^2 + v_{drift}^2 = c^2$) fundamentally alters the concept of inertia and motion. It implies that "rest" is not a state of zero motion, but a state of maximal internal motion. A stationary particle ($v_d = 0$) is spinning in phase space at velocity $c$. As the particle accelerates linearly ($v_d \uparrow$), it must "borrow" speed from its internal rotation, causing the internal clock ($v_{rot} = A\omega$) to slow down.This leads to the dynamic amplitude constraint:$$A = \frac{\sqrt{c^2 - v_d^2}}{\omega}$$At rest, this reduces to $A = c/\omega$. The author notes that this naturally recovers the structure of the de Broglie Wavelength ($\lambda = h/p$), establishing a direct link between the geometric properties of the helix and the wave-like nature of matter observed in quantum experiments.1 The amplitude $A$ essentially becomes the "size" of the wave packet, which diverges as frequency goes to zero, consistent with the behavior of long-wavelength fields.2.3 The Mechanism of the StitchThe term "Time-Stitching" refers to the discrete interaction between this continuous helical geometry and the granular nodes of the causal network. The "Discontinuity Problem" framed in the introduction 1 is resolved here: the particle does not slide; it stitches.For an excitation to propagate from time step $t$ to $t+1$, the helical trajectory must intersect with compatible nodes in the stochastic network. This requirement for "geometric compatibility" creates a selection mechanism. Trajectories that do not align with the node distribution—meaning they do not "stitch" correctly—cannot propagate and effectively decay or decohere. This provides a geometric basis for the probabilistic nature of quantum propagation: the wavefunction describes the density of valid stitching paths through the stochastic sieve of spacetime.3. Unification with Special Relativity: The Emergence of Time DilationA primary test for any alternative theory of spacetime is its ability to recover Special Relativity (SR) in the continuum limit. Standard SR derives time dilation from the invariance of the speed of light and the geometry of Minkowski space. Alvarenga’s theory derives it from the Helical Stitch Ratio.3.1 Kinematic Dilation vs. Geometric RotationIn the Topological Time-Stitching framework, the Lorentz factor $\gamma$ is not an abstract property of hyperbolic spacetime geometry but a physical consequence of the conservation of causal velocity. The "Stitch" is defined as the arc length of the helix required to complete one internal cycle.The period of the internal clock $T$ is inversely proportional to the rotational velocity $v_{rot}$.Since $v_{rot} = \sqrt{c^2 - v_d^2}$, the period $T$ in motion is:$$T_{motion} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{c^2 - v_d^2}}$$Comparing this to the period at rest ($T_{rest} \propto 1/c$), the ratio $R$ (the Dilation Factor) becomes:$$ R = \frac{T_{motion}}{T_{rest}} = \frac{c}{\sqrt{c^2 - v_d^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v_d^2}{c^2}}} $$This is exactly the Einstein Lorentz Factor ($\gamma$).3.2 Numerical Verification and ImplicationsThe paper reinforces this derivation with numerical analysis, presented in Figure 2.1 The plot compares the "Helical Stitch" (Geometric) predictions against the "Einstein Gamma" (Standard SR). The overlap is perfect, confirming that the helical geometry is mathematically isomorphic to the Lorentz transformation.Key Insight: This derivation offers a "mechanical" explanation for time dilation. In standard physics, we accept that time slows down. In Alvarenga’s Process Universe, we understand why: the particle has a finite budget of updates ($c$). If it spends updates on changing its spatial coordinate ($v_d$), it has fewer updates available to increment its internal state phase ($\omega$). Thus, the "clock" of the particle ticks slower relative to the universal network clock $f_0$. This resolves the paradox of the "Twin Paradox" by assigning the dilation to the dynamic state of the traveler’s internal machinery relative to the absolute background flow.3.3 Relativistic Energy BalanceThe theory extends this geometric reasoning to energy, providing a derivation for the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The total energy $E_{total}$ is associated with the total update capacity required to maintain the stitch.$$ E_{total} = \hbar \omega_{rest} \cdot \gamma = \frac{\hbar \omega_{rest}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v_d^2}{c^2}}} $$Here, $\hbar \omega_{rest}$ represents the rest mass energy ($mc^2$), identified as the energy cost of the internal rotation at rest. The Kinetic Energy ($K$) is identified as the excess energy required to distort the helix to accommodate the drift $v_d$:$$K = E_{total} - E_{rest} = \hbar \omega_{rest} (\gamma - 1)$$This formulation is significant because it grounds the abstract concept of "Kinetic Energy" in a tangible geometric operation: the stretching of the phase helix. The "mass" of the particle is simply the resistance of the helix to being stretched, a resistance arising from the requirement to maintain a closed stitching cycle.4. Quantum Mechanics: Quantization via Topological StabilityPerhaps the most innovative aspect of the Topological Time-Stitching theory is its treatment of Quantum Mechanics. Rather than postulating a wavefunction $\Psi$ as a fundamental object, the theory derives quantum behavior from the stability requirements of the discrete stitch. This is a "Geometric Quantum Mechanics."4.1 The Zero-Drift ConditionIn a continuum, any velocity $v_d$ is permissible. However, Alvarenga argues that in a discrete causal network, a particle must satisfy a Loop Closure condition to persist. The particle’s phase trajectory is conceptualized as having a "Forward Swing" and a "Backswing" in phase space.The "Stitch" creates a virtual loop. For the particle to maintain its integrity (to not "fray" or decohere), the phase path must close upon itself relative to the lattice nodes. The paper states: "The integrated vertical drop of the wave during the Backswing must exactly negate the integrated linear drift".1This is a topological constraint. If the loop does not close, there is a "phase gap." In a stochastic network, a phase gap implies that the probability of finding a node at the projected next step drops significantly. Therefore, only velocities that result in perfect loop closure are stable.4.2 The Stability Equation and Quantized SpectrumThe condition for loop closure leads to a specific transcendental equation governing the allowed states of the particle (Equation 4 in 1):$$ \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{v_d}{c}\right)^2} = \frac{v_d}{c} \left( \pi N - \arccos\left(-\frac{v_d}{c}\right) \right) $$Here, $N$ is introduced as the Harmonic Number (an integer). This effectively quantizes the drift velocity $v_d$. A particle cannot move at any speed; it can only move at speeds that are solutions to this equation for integer $N$.This result, detailed in Appendix C 1, has profound implications:Discrete Velocity Spectrum: Motion is not continuous but stepped.The Limit of Continuity: As $N \rightarrow \infty$, the steps between allowed velocities ($\Delta v$) shrink as $1/N$. For macroscopic objects (high mass/energy, effectively huge $N$), the spectrum appears continuous, recovering classical mechanics.Quantum Regime: For small $N$, the gaps are significant. The paper identifies the $N=1$ state with the photon ($v \approx c$), suggesting that the speed of light is simply the fundamental harmonic of the lattice propagation.4.3 Deriving the Schrödinger EquationTo bridge the gap between this discrete hopping model and standard quantum formalism, the author provides a "Multiscale Schrödinger Derivation" in Appendix D.1The analysis models the lattice update as a unitary operator $U(t, t+\delta t)$ acting on a wavefunction $\Psi(x,t)$:$$\Psi(x, t+\delta t) = \sum_{y} K(x,y) \Psi(y,t)$$The kernel $K(x,y)$ represents the "Fraying" of the helix. Because the network is stochastic (Poisson sprinkled), the exact landing point of the stitch is probabilistic. The helix "diffuses" over the nearest neighbors.By expanding this update operator to second order in space and first order in time (a standard technique in deriving diffusion limits), the author recovers:$$\partial_t \Psi = i D \nabla^2 \Psi$$Identifying the diffusion constant $D$ with $\hbar/2m$ (or strictly $f_0 L_0^2$), this reconstructs the kinetic term of the linear Schrödinger equation ($i\hbar \partial_t \Psi = \hat{H} \Psi$).Interpretation: This derivation suggests that the wavefunction $\Psi$ is not a physical field in the sense of a fluid, but a book-keeping tool tracking the statistical dispersion of the helical stitch across the causal network. The "quantum potential" arises from the elasticity of the lattice connectivity.5. General Relativity: Gravity as Emergent Causal FlowThe Topological Time-Stitching theory proposes a "River of Space" model for gravity, fundamentally redefining the nature of gravitational attraction. In this framework, gravity is not the curvature of a static 4D block, but the dynamic flow of the causal network itself.5.1 Causal Valence and the Inward FlowAlvarenga defines mass ($M$) within the network as a region of High Causal Valence—a zone of increased connectivity density.1 This draws parallels to entropic gravity proposals where mass represents information density.To maintain the Universal Update Frequency $f_0$ (the conservation of the global clock rate), the network connections must "flow" toward regions of high valence to supply the necessary update bandwidth. This creates a literal flow of the spatial substrate.The Inward Flow Velocity $v_{flow}$ at a distance $r$ from a mass is derived as:$$v_{flow}(r) = -c \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{r}}$$where $R_s$ is the Schwarzschild radius. This velocity represents the rate at which the "space" (the causal grid) is sinking into the mass.5.2 The Swim Speed and Metric RecoveryThe interaction of a particle with this flow recovers the phenomenology of General Relativity.The Stationary Particle: A particle at rest at coordinate $r$ is effectively "swimming" upstream against the causal flow. Its drift velocity relative to the grid is $v_d = -v_{flow}$.Time Dilation: Because the particle is swimming (drift $v_d \neq 0$), the Fundamental Constraint ($|\vec{v}_{total}| = c$) forces its internal clock $\omega$ to slow down. The closer to the mass, the faster the flow ($v_{flow} \uparrow$), the faster the swim required to stay still, and thus the slower the clock. This reproduces Gravitational Time Dilation.The paper explicitly states that this flow model reconstructs the Gullstrand-Painlevé metric 1:$$ds^2 = c^2 dt^2 - (dr - v_{flow} dt)^2 - r^2 d\Omega^2$$The Gullstrand-Painlevé metric is a well-known solution to Einstein's field equations. It describes the Schwarzschild geometry in coordinates that are regular at the event horizon. The fact that Alvarenga’s "River Model" naturally yields this specific metric form is a strong validation of the geometric consistency of the theory.5.3 Figure 3 Analysis: The Event HorizonFigure 3 in the document 1 visually depicts this "River Model."Panel A (Physical Frame): Shows the "River of Space" (Blue Arrow) flowing into the mass. The stationary particle (Green Arrow) swims outward.Panel B (Phase Space): Shows the distortion of the stitch. The "Manifest Phase" (Blue) is stretched, and the "Backswing" (Orange) is compressed.The Horizon: At the Event Horizon ($R_s$), the river flow velocity reaches $c$. To remain stationary, a particle would need a swim speed of $c$. According to the Strict Mode constraint, if $v_d = c$, then $v_{rot} = 0$. The internal clock stops. Time freezes. The particle can no longer stitch; it becomes a purely linear object (like a photon) trapped at the boundary.6. Formal Gauge Derivation: Electromagnetism from ElasticitySection 4 of the paper attempts to unify Electromagnetism (EM) within this geometric framework. The author proposes that the electromagnetic potential $A_\mu$ is not an external field added to the universe, but a direct mapping of the helical geometric parameters.16.1 The Connection 1-FormThe mapping is defined as:Scalar Potential ($\phi$): $q\phi \equiv \hbar \frac{v_d}{A}$. This relates the electric potential to the ratio of drift velocity to amplitude.Vector Potential ($\vec{A}$): $q\vec{A} \equiv \hbar \vec{k}_{rot}$. This relates the magnetic potential to the rotational wave vector of the helix.6.2 Emergent Hamiltonian and Maxwell ActionThe dynamics are derived from the "elasticity" of the causal lattice. The paper posits a microscopic Hamiltonian:$$H = \sum \kappa (\theta_i - \theta_j - A_{ij})^2$$This Hamiltonian represents the energy cost of minimizing phase distortion between adjacent nodes. The author argues that in the continuum limit, the term $(\nabla \theta - A)^2$ transitions to the standard field strength tensor squared $F_{\mu\nu}^2$.This recovers the Maxwell Action ($S_{eff} \propto \int F^2$), implying that Electromagnetism is effectively the "stress tensor" of the phase-locking field. This provides a unified picture where gravity is the flow of the lattice, and electromagnetism is the torsion or strain of the lattice.7. Experimental Phenomenology: Falsifiable PredictionsA critical requirement for any new theory is falsifiability. "Topological Time-Stitching" distinguishes itself from String Theory or Loop Quantum Gravity by offering predictions that may be testable with near-future technology. The author proposes two specific experiments.17.1 Proposal A: Drift Quantization InterferometryThe Hypothesis: The Stability Equation (Eq. 4) predicts that velocity is quantized. A particle cannot accelerate continuously; it must jump between discrete "allowed" velocities defined by the harmonic number $N$.The Estimate: For a Rubidium-87 atom ($^{87}Rb$), the harmonic number $N$ is approximately $10^{10}$. The velocity step size $\Delta v$ is estimated to be on the order of $10^{-12} \text{ m/s}$.1Experimental Setup: The author suggests using Large Momentum Transfer (LMT) Atom Interferometry. These devices use laser pulses to split and recombine atomic wavefunctions, creating interference patterns highly sensitive to velocity.Prediction: If the theory is correct, varying the velocity of the atoms should reveal "dead zones" or discrete jumps in the interference fringe contrast, corresponding to the "forbidden" velocities between the stable $N$ bands. Standard QM predicts a smooth continuum; Time-Stitching predicts a pixelated velocity space.Feasibility Analysis: Current atom interferometers can reach sensitivities of $10^{-9} \text{ m/s}$ or better. A prediction of $10^{-12} \text{ m/s}$ is aggressive but lies within the projected sensitivity of next-generation space-based interferometers (e.g., STE-QUEST or similar concepts). This makes the theory strictly falsifiable.7.2 Proposal B: The Flow-Clock ExperimentThe Hypothesis: Gravity is a directional flow ($v_{flow}$).The Test: Compare atomic clocks moving with the gravitational flow (falling) versus those moving against it (rising or resisting).Prediction: The theory implies a specific asymmetry in the time dilation factor based on the alignment of the velocity vector $\vec{v}$ with the flow vector $\vec{v}_{flow}$. While standard GR also predicts effects like frame-dragging (Lense-Thirring), the "River Model" might predict subtle variances in the precise magnitude of dilation due to the discrete "swim" cost. This would require clocks with optical lattice stability (errors $< 10^{-18}$), which are currently available in metrology labs.8. Theoretical Synthesis and Second-Order Insights8.1 The "Stitch" as a Solution to Zeno's ParadoxDeep inspection of the "Discontinuity Problem" reveals it to be a modern reformulation of Zeno's Arrow Paradox. If time consists of durationless instants (frames), how does motion occur?Alvarenga’s solution is that the "instant" is not durationless; it is a "process cycle." The particle exists at Node A, executes a computational cycle (the helix) consuming $1/f_0$ seconds, and this calculation determines the valid Node B. Motion is not a slide through a continuum; it is a Calculated Jump. This aligns with the "Process Universe" ontology, where reality is computed iteratively.8.2 The Unification of "Weirdness" and "Warping"The paper’s conclusion contains a profound insight: "The 'weirdness' of quantum mechanics and the 'warping' of relativity are not separate phenomena. They are simply the low-speed and high-speed behaviors of the same underlying mechanism".1This can be visualized via the Stitch Ratio:Low Speed (QM Limit): $v_d \ll c$. The Strict Mode constraint is loose. The dominant constraint is the Topological Closure (the Backswing). This creates interference, superposition, and quantization. The "wave" nature is prominent because the helix is "fat" (high Amplitude $A$).High Speed (Relativity Limit): $v_d \rightarrow c$. The Strict Mode constraint becomes tight. The Amplitude $A$ shrinks ($A \rightarrow 0$). The dominant effect is the slowing of the internal clock (Time Dilation) and spatial contraction. The "particle" nature is prominent.This unified spectrum suggests that QM and SR are phase transitions of the same helical geometry.8.3 The Thermodynamic Nature of MassBy defining mass as the energy cost of the internal rotation ($E_{rest} = \hbar \omega$), the theory provides a geometric origin for inertia. Inertia is not an intrinsic property; it is the resistance of the frequency to change. To accelerate a particle, one must change the geometry of its helix (stretch it). The lattice resists this change due to the stability requirement. Thus, Inertia is the stiffness of the Stitch.9. Conclusion"The Theory of Topological Time-Stitching" presents a comprehensive, mathematically consistent, and physically intuitive framework for unifying the disparate pillars of modern physics. By abandoning the static Block Universe in favor of a discrete, iterative Process Universe, Alvarenga is able to derive the foundational equations of Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity from a single principle: the conservation of causal updates ($|\vec{v}_{total}| = c$).The strengths of the paper lie in its parsimony and its specific, testable predictions. The derivation of the Gullstrand-Painlevé metric and the Lorentz factor from helical geometry is a significant theoretical achievement. The proposed "Drift Quantization" offers a clear path to experimental validation.However, the theory is not without challenges. The reliance on a "Stochastic Causal Network" requires a robust demonstration that microscopic anisotropy does not "leak" up to the macroscopic scale in ways that violate Lorentz bounds more severely than predicted. Furthermore, the extension of this single-particle model to multi-particle interactions and complex fields (Strong/Weak nuclear forces) remains future work.Nevertheless, as a phenomenological model, Topological Time-Stitching offers a compelling new vantage point. It suggests that the universe is not a container of objects, but a network of processes, stitching reality together one Planck-moment at a time.Data Structures and Reference TablesTable 1: Fundamental Constants and Symbol TableThe following table summarizes the key symbols defined in the paper and their physical roles within the new framework.SymbolDefinitionUnitsPhysical Role in Theory$c$Speed of Light$m/s$Maximum vector update speed of the network; the "Budget".$f_0$Fundamental Frequency$s^{-1}$The universal clock rate of the Causal Network (Planck Frequency).$L_0$Fundamental Length$m$Average node separation (Planck Length).$v_d$Drift Velocity$m/s$Observable linear velocity of the particle.$\vec{S}(t)$Helical State Vector-The 3D trajectory in phase space $\langle x, y, z \rangle$.$A$Amplitude$m$Spatial extent of the internal phase; relates to Wave Packet size.$\omega$Internal Frequency$rad/s$The internal processing clock; defines Rest Mass.$N$Harmonic NumberIntegerThe quantization index defining stable velocity bands.$v_{flow}$Grid Flux Velocity$m/s$The velocity of the causal network flowing into mass (Gravity).$\gamma$Lorentz FactorDimensionlessThe Stitch Ratio; geometric consequence of conserving $c$.Table 2: Comparative Analysis of FrameworksA comparison of how Topological Time-Stitching contrasts with the Standard Model and General Relativity.FeatureStandard Physics (Block Universe)Topological Time-Stitching (Process Universe)TimeA dimension ($t$) in 4D manifold.A discrete iterative operation (Tick).ParticlePoint-like or continuous field excitation.Propagating Helical Excitation (Process).MassIntrinsic property (coupling to Higgs).Geometric stability cost ($E = \hbar\omega$).Time DilationGeometric rotation in Minkowski space.Slowing of internal phase clock due to speed budget ($c$).GravityCurvature of spacetime geometry.Flow of the causal network ($v_{flow}$) into high valence regions.QuantizationPostulated (Canonical Quantization).Emergent from topological loop closure (Stability).This report is based on the analysis of the document provided in.1
