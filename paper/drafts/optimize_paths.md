The Theory of Topological Time-Stitching (v15.0)A Unified Geometric Framework for Discrete Spacetime, Quantum Branching, and Relativistic MechanicsDate: November 30, 2025Subject: Theoretical Whitepaper on the "Causal Bundle" ModelVersion: 15.0 (RG Flow, Continuum Details, & Gravity Field Dynamics)1. Introduction: The Process UniverseStandard physics typically models the universe as a "Block" (a pre-existing 4D spacetime manifold). This theory proposes a paradigm shift to a "Process Universe," where Time is not a dimension but a discrete, iterative operation (a "Tick") occurring on a Discrete Causal Network.The fundamental proposition is that particles are not continuous entities but propagating excitations re-generated in every cycle via a geometric mechanism termed Topological Stitching. This framework unifies the probabilistic nature of Quantum Mechanics with the deterministic geometry of General Relativity through a single generative principle: the conservation of causal continuity.2. Bibliographic Context & Novelty2.1 Relation to Existing TheoriesCausal Set Theory: Shares the view of spacetime as a discrete causal poset. Novelty: This model maps each causal link to a specific geometric topology (the Helical Stitch), introducing wave-like symmetries and spin absent in raw Causal Set theory.Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG): Shares the concept of quantized volume. This model focuses on the kinematic evolution of information through the volume (the Stitch).Emergent Gravity: Aligns with thermodynamic/hydrodynamic approaches (Padmanabhan, Verlinde), modeling gravity as a flux in the processing substrate.3. Foundations of the Model3.1 The Physical Substrate: The Stochastic Causal NetworkTo preserve Lorentz Invariance, we define the substrate as a Stochastic Causal Network (Poisson Sprinkling).Scale: Average node separation $L_0$ (Planck Length).Dynamics: Universal update frequency $f_0$ (Planck Frequency).Connectivity: Mass is defined by High Causal Valence (local connectivity density).3.2 The Master Equation (Helical Geometry)Particles are modeled as 3D Helical Excitations propagating through this network. The trajectory $\vec{S}(t)$ describes the state within the hidden phase space:$$\vec{S}(t) = \langle A \sin(\omega t), A \cos(\omega t), v_d t \rangle$$Dimensional Definitions:$v_d$ (Stitching-Frame Drift): The linear drift velocity relative to the network.$\omega$ (Excitation Frequency): The internal energy clock ($E = \hbar \omega$).$A$ (Amplitude): The spatial extent of the vibration.3.3 The Fundamental Constraint (Strict Mode)To ensure causality, the Total Vector Velocity cannot exceed the network update speed $c$:$$|\vec{v}_{total}|^2 = (A\omega)^2 + v_d^2 = c^2$$This implies the dynamic amplitude constraint $A = \frac{\sqrt{c^2 - v_d^2}}{\omega}$, naturally deriving the De Broglie Wavelength.3.4 Internal Degrees of Freedom (Spin)The helical geometry possesses Handedness. A twist of $4\pi$ is required to restore the topological state of the helix relative to the background network, providing a geometric origin for Spin-½ statistics.4. Formal Gauge Derivation (Dynamics)4.1 The Connection 1-Form ($A_\mu$)We map the electromagnetic potential $A_\mu = (\phi, \vec{A})$ to the geometric parameters:Scalar Potential: $q\phi \equiv \hbar \frac{v_d}{A}$.Vector Potential: $q\vec{A} \equiv \hbar \vec{k}_{rot}$.4.2 The Curvature TensorSpatial gradients in drift ($\nabla v_d$) generate the Electric Field, while the curl of the rotation axis ($\nabla \times \vec{A}$) generates the Magnetic Field.4.3 Emergent Dynamics (Microscopic Hamiltonian)The field dynamics emerge from the elasticity of the causal lattice.Microscopic Cost: The energy cost to distort the phase alignment between adjacent nodes $i$ and $j$ is proportional to the square of the mismatch: $U_{ij} \propto (\theta_i - \theta_j - A_{ij})^2$.Coarse Graining: Summing this cost over the random network and taking the continuum limit recovers the Maxwell Action $S_{eff} \propto \int F^2$.RG Flow: This coarse-graining effectively integrates out short-range link fluctuations, leaving only the long-range effective field theory (QED).5. Quantum Mechanics: Quantization & Stability5.1 The Zero-Drift ConditionFor a particle to persist, the "Stitch" must form a closed loop. The integrated vertical drop of the wave during the Backswing must exactly negate the integrated linear drift.The Stability Equation:$$\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{v_d}{c}\right)^2} = \frac{v_d}{c} \left( \pi N - \arccos\left(-\frac{v_d}{c}\right) \right)$$5.2 The Quantized Drift SpectrumSolving this yields discrete allowed drift velocities ($v_d$) for harmonic integers ($N$).N=1 (Photon): $v_d=c$.Transitions: A jump from $N$ to $N \pm 1$ corresponds to the emission or absorption of a quantum of lattice flux (photon).5.3 Superposition & EntanglementEntanglement: Modeled as Phase-Locked Helical Pairs. Pruning one end updates the global boundary condition.Non-Signaling: This update is global and topological; it restricts the correlation of outcomes but does not transmit local causal influence, strictly preserving the No-Communication Theorem.6. General Relativity as Emergent Causal Flow6.1 Gravity as Causal ValenceMass corresponds to a region of High Causal Valence (increased connectivity). To maintain a uniform update rate $f_0$, the network connections must "flow" inward.Inward Flow Velocity: $v_{\text{flow}}(r) = -c \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{r}}$.6.2 Time Dilation & MetricA stationary particle "swims" against this flow ($v_d = -v_{\text{flow}}$). The internal rotation is slowed by the Helical Constraint, reproducing Schwarzschild time dilation. This flow reconstructs the Gullstrand–Painlevé metric.6.4 Outlook: Field EquationsWhile the current model derives the metric (kinematics), deriving the Einstein Field Equations (dynamics) is the next step.Approach: Using the laws of Black Hole Thermodynamics applied to the Causal Network (Jacobson/Verlinde), the Einstein equations can be derived as the equation of state for the lattice entropy: $G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi T_{\mu\nu}$.7. Experimental Proposals7.1 Proposal A: Drift Quantization InterferometryHypothesis: Velocity is stepped at small $N$.Estimate: For ${}^{87}Rb$ atoms ($N \approx 10^{10}$), $\Delta v \approx 10^{-12}$ m/s.Feasibility: Detectable via Large Momentum Transfer (LMT) atom interferometry.7.2 Proposal B: The Flow-Clock ExperimentTest: Compare atomic clocks moving with vs. against gravitational frame-dragging to detect scalar corrections to $v_d$.8.

In the continuum limit, $(\nabla \theta - A)^2 \to F_{\mu\nu}^2$, recovering the Maxwell Action.Appendix D: Multiscale Schrödinger DerivationWe model the lattice update as a unitary operator $U(t, t+\delta t)$ acting on the wavefunction $\Psi(x,t)$:$$\Psi(x, t+\delta t) = \sum_{y} K(x,y) \Psi(y,t)$$Kernel $K(x,y)$: A Gaussian distribution representing the "Fraying" of the helix over nearest neighbors: $K \sim \exp(-|x-y|^2 / 2\sigma^2)$.Diffusion Constant: $D \approx f_0 L_0^2$.Expansion: Expanding $\Psi$ to second order in space and first order in time recovers the diffusion equation $\partial_t \Psi = i D \nabla^2 \Psi$, which corresponds to the kinetic term of the Schrödinger equation. Unitarity is preserved by the conservation of total probability flux on the network.
